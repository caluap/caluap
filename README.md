Olá! I’m a Ph.D. student and Fulbright fellow in the Computing and Information Sciences Program at Rochester Institute of Technology. I am a member of the Center for Accessibility and Inclusion Research Lab ([CAIR](https://cair.rit.edu/)), where I am advised by [Matt Huenerfauth](https://huenerfauth.ist.rit.edu/) in accessibility research, with a focus on captioning technology.

Previously, I obtained a master’s degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Campinas, working with [Paula Costa](https://pdpcosta.github.io/) on speech-modulated typography. My thesis can be found [here](https://repositorio.unicamp.br/acervo/detalhe/1241950).

I am also a co-founder of [Preface](https://www.preface.com.br/), a design studio from Campinas, Brazil. Since 2007, we have worked with clients from many sectors, with a particular focus on [educational projects](https://www.olimpiadadedehistoria.com.br/). For my work as a designer there, I [have](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIna2X1BXNQ/) [won](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5Jl5pqBIrw/) [some](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2evRG2nWc6/) [awards](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqgLcmRFi1Z/).
